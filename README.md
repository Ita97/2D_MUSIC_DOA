MATLAB code of 2D MUSIC for DOA estimation (azimuth and elevation). 
Unlike the MATLAB official function, this code allows spatial smoothing for correlated signals (i.e., multipath components), and the code is publicly available!
Peak detection is performed using "Fast 2D peak finder" (2021), Adi Natan code (Available at: <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/37388-fast-2d-peak-finder">FileExchange</a> or <a href="https://github.com/adinatan/fastpeakfind">Github</a>).
